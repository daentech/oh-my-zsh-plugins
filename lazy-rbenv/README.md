# lazy-rbenv

## Plugin

Initialises rbenv lazily. Only calls it when `rbenv`, `ruby`, `gem` or another ruby dependent command is run

## Usage

- Copy the plugin directory to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` to leave you with `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/lazy-rbenv/lazy-rbenv.plugin.zsh`
- Add `lazy-rbenv` to your plugins array in `~/.zshrc`
